I enjoy working with web-focused technologies. Intimately familiar with browser apis, debuggers, and quirks. Can transform any design in to a responsive web experience. Knows how to debug, and find performance bottlenecks.

#### Professional Work
Most recently a solo-freelance dev.<br />
Before that a Software Engineer at Glowforge (laser cutters). <br />

#### School
I have a scholastic background in Computer Science and professional experience working on web platforms.

I took an interest in programming because of web technologies. My friend introduced me to Flash programming for web games on Newgrounds and Miniclip.  Since then I have focused on the web platform for work. I enjoy working with browsers, and bringing UI and UX ideas to life. Additionally, I've gotten good at developing software in support of websites and web apps - fullstack development, dev-ops, integration, design systems, and more.
