[Train Otaku](Train%20Otaku.md) is a project I started because I had some questions about the trains in proximity to where I was living in Bombay Beach.

Where are they going?<br/>
Where are they coming from?<br/>
What's on the trains?<br/>
How many train cars are there?<br/>

**Goal**
Use machine learning to understand some of these questions. Count train cars, analyze train cars, summarize trains, remix trains.

## [Train Otaku - Update 2024-06-15](Train%20Otaku%20-%20Update%202024-06-15.md)
I made some progress while at Edge Esmeralda on training the YOLOv8 machine learning model on individual train cars.


## Update 2024-06-19
- Trained YoloV10 - doesn't do much better. Undercoujnts, less false positives
- YoloV8 tends to double count.
- Maybe need higher res training data?
- what is best way to train? Find someone to ask.
