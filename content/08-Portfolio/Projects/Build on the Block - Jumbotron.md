A single page scoreboard for the Build on the Block 2023 contest put on by 35th North skateshop in Seattle, WA. Built to be displayed on a ~50inch tv monitor outside.

I was also commissioned to build a ramp for By And By - [Build on the Block - Wedge Ramp](Build%20on%20the%20Block%20-%20Wedge%20Ramp.md)

## Tech Overview

This is a Preact single page app (See [/src/pages/Home.jsx](https://github.com/bigredwill/build-on-the-block/blob/main/src/pages/Home.jsx)). Completed quickly, it worked great for the contest. Allows for user input and saves to local storage in case of lost connection or page refresh.

Using [preact-cli](https://github.com/preactjs/preact-cli), with [vercel cli](https://vercel.com/docs/cli), the app was deployed and ready to go. 10/10 would use this setup again.
