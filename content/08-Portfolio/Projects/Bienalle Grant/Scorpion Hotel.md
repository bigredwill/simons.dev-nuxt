## Summary
Found objects, using blacklights and solar panels to light up a wooden structure using old weathered wood. This would look like a creatively placed wooden structure in the daytime. At night, it will light up with a black light underglow to hopefully highlight the Arizona Bark Scorpion's that reside here in the desert.

These scorpions will glow under the lithium powered black lights.

## **Approximate Size**:
6 feet long by 6 feet tall by 6 feet wide (though I could go bigger given the right space)

## **Materials**:
- Found desert wood.
- Blacklight LED strips (maybe some higher end ones that really make the scorpions shine)
- donor solar yard lights for Solar panel, battery, and charge controllers
- Some kind of natural sealant for wood, likely some epoxy for electronics.
