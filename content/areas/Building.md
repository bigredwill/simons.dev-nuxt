I enjoy building physical things with my hands. I have worked with wood, metal, concrete, electronics, paint, old junk, and more.  Here's a few projects I've documented enough to be online:
- [Sunlab gate](../projects/Sunlab%20gate.md)
- [LP-01](../projects/LP-01.md)
- [Build on the Block - Wedge Ramp](../projects/Build%20on%20the%20Block%20-%20Wedge%20Ramp.md)
- [Triangle Slappy Rail](../projects/Triangle%20Slappy%20Rail.md)
- [Bombay Beach Quarter Pipe](../projects/Bombay%20Beach%20Quarter%20Pipe.md)
