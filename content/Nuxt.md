This site is built with [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com), which is a meta-framework for [Vue](https://vuejs.org). I have used React since 2016, and wanted to try out something different. I talk about the site setup in [simons.dev - Nuxt Content + Obsidian](simons.dev%20-%20Nuxt%20Content%20+%20Obsidian.md).

Nuxt reminds me of Ruby on Rails in some ways. The "magic" of the framework means that I don't need to import everything. It reduces a ton of boilerplate code. That said, magic can backfire when something breaks, and we don't know why.
