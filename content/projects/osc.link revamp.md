Hacking on [osc.link](https://osc.link).  

The github repository https://github.com/laubsauger/osc.link.

> OSC.LINK is a control interface for realtime interaction between a mobile or desktop browser, and the OSC protocol. It was designed for the rapid-prototyping of multi-user media installations, and simple extensible deployment for mobile phone interaction without the cumbersome steps of joining a network, downloading an app, or signing up for an account.
