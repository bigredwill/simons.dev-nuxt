Sometimes, to be perceived as legit, all something needs is a sign.

## Here are some signs I've made (and documented)

### BlackLightAngle
 February 2024 - Mars College.
Ok this one is a stretch to call a sign, but it's a symbol for the DarkArts (listening to music in the dark windy desert night). This was a #onedaybuild

### Kamar Taj / ASMR
March 2023 - Bombay Beach
Two signs in one image 
1. The big `AS` in the background are repaired and repurposed from Luke's Mars project (the letters originally were aligned to say MARS). I mended the signs with a welder and re-bolting 2x6s for rigidity.
2. A laser engraved sign for Kamar Taj sanctuary.

### New Design Row
From November 2022, when I still worked at Glowforge. We had a section of the office called Design Row, that was moved, so I made a sign that said New Design Row. Not at all related to my job responsibilities as a software engineer for them. One of the best perks of working at Glowforge was getting to use a Glowforge, and seeing what everyone else was making.
