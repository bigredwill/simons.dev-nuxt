At Bombay Beach in California's Sonoran desert, two cargo trains pass by, their powerful engines interrupting the serene silence with a reminder of industry and technological advancement.  
  
We pause to observe the contrast between the raw power of the trains and the natural beauty of the landscape, and observe the interplay between silence and noise, monotony and change, the past, present, and future.
