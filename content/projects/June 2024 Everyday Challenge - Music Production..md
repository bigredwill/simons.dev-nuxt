**Goal**: Make a track everyday in June.

Some months I like to do everyday challenges. These push creative output even when I'm not "feeling" creative. I believe this is how progress is made.

This is a good way to deal with post-break-up energy.

Some days the sounds are bad, some they are good. I finished and released two songs and music videos:

1. [hermeto amen](Music/hermeto%20amen.md)
2. [path of insanity](Music/path%20of%20insanity.md)
