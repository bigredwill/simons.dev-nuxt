For the past few years, I have lived nomadically. Periodically shifting my presence up and down the West Coast of the United States.

I began this dynamic journey in January 2023 when I left Seattle and went to the Mars College to live by the California Salton Sea. Thus began my slow travel, moving periodically between known places. When it is too hot in the desert, I go North. When the weather turns, and the rains come, I am drawn to the desert, so far.

Financially, I am affording this through independent freelance gigs, low-cost living, and savings. I worked for 5 years straight knowing that I wanted to take extended time off between full-time gigs to go deeper on creativity, relationships, and self inquiry.
